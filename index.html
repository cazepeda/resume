          <dt>Web Developer III</dt>
          <dt><a href="https://utrgv.edu">The University of Texas Rio Grande Valley</a> • Edinburg, TX</dt>
          <dd>40 Hours/Week</dd>
          <dd>Developed the global website template with Velocity templating engine. This simplified website development within the Cascade CMS. All related website assets and content creation was baked into the workflow. You could have a website built in a day.</dd>
          <dd>Developed website specific widgets for pulling dynamically news related content, PDF viewer, photo galleries, embedded video galleries, and many more features that allowed the user to modify and update their websites easily.</dd>
          <dd>Redesigned the university wide email and website: <a href="https://messenger.utrgv.edu">messenger.utrgv.edu</a>. Simplified the content and focused on audience related topics. This project utilized the following tools, Angular, bootstrap, custom CSS and responsive layouts for all devices.</dd>
          <dd>Redesigned the university intranet website: <a href="https://my.utrgv.edu">my.utrgv.edu</a>. Created a responsive layout to function in any device and simplified the user login utilizing single-sign on methodology. This allowed me to get rid of the user email and password fields. The user only needs to press the login button. This project utilized Liferay CMS, ClayUI, Bootstrap, and custom CSS.</dd>
          <dd>Developed front-end design for the universities faculty profiles single-page web application: <a href="https://utrgv.edu/courseinfo">utrgv.edu/courseinfo</a>. This is a heavily visited website especially for students to find out about their professors and courses. This project utilized Angular, custom CSS and JavaScript. This website is completely responsive and functional on all devices.</dd>
          <dd>Developed the <a href="https://www.utrgv.edu/parking-and-transportation-services/parking-services/parking-spaces/">Parking Spaces widget</a> for the Parking and Transportation Services department. This project's goal was to provide helpful information for students finding parking. The students had raised an issue regarding finding parking very difficult. I worked with the Parking and Transportation Services department to develop and design the parking widget that utilized hardware data from the available parking lots. The API endpoint provided was converted to JSON and with the fetch API I was able to format it to HTML and style it with custom CSS.</dd>
          <dd>Developed the universities <a href="https://www.utrgv.edu/directory/az-index/">A-Z Index of Departments and Offices</a> search page. The goal of this project was to provide department and offices contact information to the public and internally. The data was extracted from the Cascade CMS REST API and then converted to JSON for easier formatting to HTML. This data was also combined to handle our roles and permissions with Active Directory.</dd>
          <dd>I was also responsible for CMS administration and maintenance. This involved working with university database and systems teams to do patches/upgrades to our CMS application, and CMS environments/web servers. This required documentation that was provided to the involved parties and testing of each patch and upgrade.</dd>

          <dt>Web Designer</dt>
          <dt><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150905052330/http://www.utpa.edu/">The University of Texas-Pan American</a> • Edinburg, TX</dt>
          <dd>40 Hours/Week</dd>
          <dd>Standardized website web forms utilizing Coldfusion server language. This simplified the creation of the web forms by simply copy and pasting HTML code into our web pages. Also created data retrieval of those web forms to create reports in CSV format to provide the users who managed the web forms.</dd>
          <dd>WordPress development and maintenance. I developed a custom theme for the university to be available for all department/programs/offices. The theme allowed the flexibility for the departments/programs/offices to brand their blogs to reflect their personality while keeping with the university style guide and guidelines. This theme was also designed to be responsive and function in all devices. Accessibility was also baked into the HTML in order for anyone to access the information with any devices or screen reader.</dd>
          <dd>Developed style guide for the web team in order to have a uniform and visual standardization of our department/program/office websites. This included slideshow, accordion, lists components, and typography.</dd>
          <dd>Developed and managed maintenance of faculty web spaces. This environment allowed faculty members to use these web spaces to create their personal websites or websites related to their courses. I developed a default theme for them to use as a starter website and allowed for flexibility to make it their own. This was a .ASP web server environment we utilized.</dd>
          <dd>Provided support and development for iModules CMS for the Development (Giving) department. This required training staff how to utilize the CMS to create web forms to accept donations. This collaboration initiated a beginning of income to the university via our website properties. This allowed the public to access our websites to contribute to the university with their money. I created a template that could be embedded into our main website content management system.</dd>
          <dd>Created a <a href="https://gist.github.com/cazepeda-zz/3967172">JavaScript bookmarklet</a> to access the Oracle CMS we were initially utilizing. This ancient CMS did not provide a login button when we needed to edit a specific web page. So if you were to login, you'd be redirected to the homepage of the CMS rather than the page you needed to edit. With this bookmarklet we could pass the parameters to the URL on the page we need to edit and NOT be redirected to the homepage. Before the bookmarklet my coworkers would have two windows opened, one for the page they want to edit and reference it for the URL path. The second window would be to login and then navigate through the navigation tree until they could find the page they needed to edit. Super tedious! The bookmarklet absolutely improved productivity and relief. We named it “Edit Mode”. Everyone in our team up to the boss utilized it. It also inspired one of the programmers in the team to modify it for his use.</dd>
